// MARK: Generic Class for Calling Api with URL Session as they get better with Swift 5. We can still use AFNetworking Pod for API Calling with SwiftyJSON to parse the data but instead I pereferd to use Apple own Class.

    // MARK: Using Completion Handler in asynchronous functions is useful such as API Calling. As it will provide you the call back whenever the task is completed such as when the API return a response. We use closure for completion handler so that when the function returns after it starts the operation, but the closure isn't called until the operation is completedâ€”the closure needs to escape, to be called later.
